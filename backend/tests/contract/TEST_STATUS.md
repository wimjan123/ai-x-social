# AI Personas Contract Tests Status

## Tests Created

### T019: GET /api/personas (personas.list.test.ts)
- ✅ **Created** - Comprehensive contract test for listing AI personas
- ❌ **Failing** - Returns 404 because endpoint doesn't exist yet
- 🎯 **Focus** - Tests political diversity, persona types, filtering, schema compliance

### T020: GET /api/personas/{personaId} (personas.get.test.ts)
- ✅ **Created** - Contract test for individual persona retrieval
- ❌ **Failing** - Returns 404 because endpoint doesn't exist yet
- 🎯 **Focus** - Tests detailed persona characteristics, political alignment validation

### T021: POST /api/personas/{personaId}/reply (personas.reply.test.ts)
- ✅ **Created** - Critical contract test for AI response generation
- ❌ **Failing** - Returns 404 because endpoint doesn't exist yet
- 🎯 **Focus** - Tests political simulation accuracy, demo mode fallback, conservative vs liberal responses

## Key Test Features

### Political Simulation Validation
- Tests for conservative vs liberal response patterns
- Validates political alignment affects AI responses
- Checks for opposing viewpoints on topics like healthcare, gun control
- Ensures consistent persona voice across multiple topics

### Demo Mode Fallback
- Tests AI service unavailability handling
- Validates demo responses are contextually relevant
- Ensures graceful degradation when AI providers fail

### Contract Compliance
- Full OpenAPI schema validation
- Proper HTTP status codes and error handling
- Authentication and authorization testing
- Performance and rate limiting requirements

### Content Quality
- Tests for harmful content filtering
- Professional discourse standards
- Appropriate political language usage
- Context-aware response generation

## Expected Test Behavior

**BEFORE Implementation:**
- All endpoint tests return 404 (correct failure)
- Error handling tests may pass (app correctly handles invalid requests)
- Configuration/setup issues resolved

**AFTER Implementation:**
- All tests should pass when endpoints are properly implemented
- Political simulation tests will validate AI persona behavior
- Demo mode tests will verify fallback mechanisms work

## Critical Requirements Tested

1. **AI Persona Diversity** - Conservative and liberal personas respond differently
2. **Context Awareness** - Responses relate to provided context and news items
3. **Political Alignment** - Consistent ideological positioning in responses
4. **Demo Mode** - Graceful handling when AI services are unavailable
5. **Schema Compliance** - All responses match OpenAPI specifications
6. **Security** - Proper authentication and data privacy

These tests ensure the AI personas feature works correctly for the political simulation platform and maintain quality standards for user experience.
