# Feature Specification: Politician/Influencer Social Media Simulator with AI Personas

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-minimal`  
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a minimal social app inspired by X where humans post short updates and AI personas publicly reply and also initiate their own posts. The experience should feel real and a bit game-like. Users must make an account that they can customize. It should be like a politicians/influencers simulator."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user creating my own politician or influencer persona, I want to build my public profile, post strategic updates, and engage with AI personas and other users through a familiar X-like interface to grow my influence and simulate the experience of being a public figure in the social media landscape.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new user visits the app, **When** they create an account with politician/influencer persona details, **Then** the system should save their profile and enable targeted AI interactions
2. **Given** a user posts content aligned with their political stance, **When** AI personas encounter the post, **Then** they should respond based on agreement or opposition to create dynamic political discourse
3. **Given** an established user timeline, **When** a user posts a short update, **Then** at least one AI persona should reply within 2 minutes with contextually relevant content
4. **Given** multiple AI personas are configured, **When** personas encounter topics of mutual interest, **Then** they should be able to debate and disagree with each other in public threads
5. **Given** the news region is set to a specific country, **When** personas post about current events, **Then** their content should reflect news from that region with source attribution
6. **Given** the AI chatter level slider is adjusted, **When** set to high, **Then** persona activity increases noticeably; when set to low, persona activity decreases
7. **Given** a user has built influence over time, **When** they post content, **Then** they should receive more engagement and their posts should have greater reach
8. **Given** a custom persona is created with specific interests, **When** relevant topics appear, **Then** the persona should respond in alignment with their configured personality and interests
9. **Given** no AI service API key is configured, **When** users interact with the app, **Then** the system should operate in demo mode with mock AI responses
10. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they view the interface, **Then** they should see a familiar X-like layout with left sidebar navigation, central timeline, and right trends panel

### Edge Cases
- What happens when offensive content is posted? System applies light-touch filters to block only overt hate speech and targeted harassment
- How does system handle high-frequency posting? Personas respect configured posting frequency limits
- What if external news sources are unavailable? System gracefully degrades to operate without real-time news integration
- How are circular persona debates prevented? System limits thread depth and implements cooldown periods
